# Chit Chat
> Just another Meteor project

This is a demo of a meteor-based app that works like this:

* You have a single character that can move in 2D environment
* Should work fine with desktop and mobile
* When you connect, a character is generated automatically
* You can talk by pressing the record button
* It records your microphone (works also with mobile)
* All the characters that are in your vicinity will hear your speech

This was kind of a cool demo to work with. The idea was to test a 2D space where
you could mingle around with people and join conversation naturally; just by
"walking in" to some group of conversation.

You could also leave a conversation just by walking off it.

So you could say that this is a "cocktail party simulator".
